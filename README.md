# Quiz Analyzer

## Overview
**Quiz Analyzer** is an interactive data analysis tool designed to evaluate quiz performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and provide actionable insights for learners. By leveraging Python libraries like Plotly for interactive visualizations, this project offers a detailed analysis of quiz results, helping users enhance their learning experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore quiz performance through dynamic bar charts and pie charts that display metrics such as correct answers, incorrect answers, and question distribution by topic and difficulty.
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify strengths and weaknesses across various subjects and difficulty levels through detailed reports.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Receive targeted suggestions for improvement based on performance trends.
- **JSON Data Integration**: Import quiz data provided as JSON files from an API endpoint for analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate interactive dashboards with clear and concise representations of data.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvement over time with historical performance comparisons.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for data processing and visualization.
- **Plotly**: A library for creating interactive and visually appealing plots and charts.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: (Optional) For generating static charts and plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for developing and demonstrating the project.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run **Quiz Analyzer** on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuizAnalyzer.git
   cd QuizAnalyzer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook file `QuizAnalyzer.ipynb` in your browser and execute the cells.

## Usage
1. **Retrieve your data**:
   - Ensure your quiz data is available as JSON files provided by the API endpoint.
   - Use Python's `requests` library to fetch the data from the endpoint, for example:
     ```python
     import requests

     url = "https://api.example.com/quiz-data"
     response = requests.get(url)
     if response.status_code == 200:
         quiz_data = response.json()
     else:
         print("Failed to fetch data.")
     ```

2. **Process your data**:
   - Convert the JSON data into a DataFrame for analysis:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     df = pd.json_normalize(quiz_data)
     ```

3. **Explore visualizations**:
   - View bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots for performance insights.

4. **Generate recommendations**:
   - Analyze results and receive personalized suggestions for improvement based on performance data.

## Logic of the Project
The core logic of **Quiz Analyzer** involves the following steps:

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Fetch JSON data from a specified API endpoint.
   - Parse and normalize the JSON into a tabular format (using Pandas) for further processing.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Categorize questions based on topics, difficulty levels, and performance metrics (e.g., correct/incorrect answers).
   - Calculate aggregate statistics such as total correct answers, accuracy rate, and topic-wise performance.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Use Plotly to create dynamic and interactive visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.
   - Highlight key metrics such as question accuracy, topic distribution, and performance trends over time.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Identify areas where the user excels or struggles based on the analyzed data.
   - Generate personalized recommendations to focus on weaker topics or difficulty levels.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Provide an intuitive interface via Jupyter Notebook, where users can upload data, view results, and explore recommendations.
